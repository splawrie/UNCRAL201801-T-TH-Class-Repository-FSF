				<p>I pride myself in being a resourceful program analyst and strategic thinker, experienced in data management. I love balancing an intuitive user interface with proper data management. I am passionate about organization and attention to detail.
				</p>

				<p>I am a natural organizer able to absorb large amounts of detailed information. I enjoy strategizing and planning program changes, that will promote efficiencies in systems and the way that program components operate together. I utilize software tools to perform what-if analysis on the effects of program changes on program performance.
				</p>

				<p>I have strong communication and presentation skills. In addition to assimilating information about existing programs and researching potential program changes, I also effectively present the results of my research in a clear manner.
				</p>

				<p>Over the past several years I have led training classes at North Carolina Department of Public Instructionâ€™s annual symposium. Classes I have led include: Beginning SQL, SQL4 Reports, Importing and Exporting Data, New Data Manager Training, A Year in NCWise, Dropout, Excel, Electronic High School Transcript, Reporting Hub, Using Excel for Labels, etc.
